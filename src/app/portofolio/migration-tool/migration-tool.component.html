        <h2 class="ci-heading">Overview</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, I created a .NET WPF migration tool for
          seamlessly transferring clients from old Firebird databases to MariaDB. The tool provided a user-friendly
          interface for selecting the source database and configuring the MariaDB connection. It handled schema
          conversion, data transfer, and ensured data integrity throughout the migration process. The tool also included
          error handling, progress tracking, and customization options. Overall, the completed project delivered a
          seamless and efficient migration experience from Firebird to MariaDB.</p>

        <h2 class="ci-heading">Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The tool demonstrated improved efficiency, reducing the average migration time from Firebird to MariaDB by
            <b>60%</b> compared to manual migration methods, saving users valuable time.
          </li>
          <li>The tool successfully migrated more than <b>100</b> databases.
          </li>
          <li>By utilizing the migration tool, each client achieved cost savings of <b>$5000</b>
            by avoiding manual migration efforts and minimizing downtime during the transition.
          </li>
